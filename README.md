# Laser Beam Node
An all in one Godot 4 node to make all kinds of highly customisable laserbeams with no coding required. Standalone addon of the laserbeam feature in my bullethell plugin : https://github.com/Dark-Peace/BulletUpHell


Just put it in the addon folder and use the LaserBeam scene.

Features include (but are not limited to):

- laser bouncing off walls

- spawning scenes on impact (could be used for explosions)

- full control on laser's collision and propagation behavior
